# LD46
Let's see what havoc we will have wrought after this weekend.

Guess it'll be cat-themed. Good.

To-do:
- ~~Brainstorm and choose game.~~
- Clicks trigger animations
- Camera setup for continuous scroll or separate scenes with transition
- Assets
  - ~~Cat~~ textures
    - ~~Pounce~~
    - ~~Run~~
    - Sit
    - Scratch
    - Jump up
    - Jump down
    - Yawn
    - Sleep
  - ~~Walnut~~ textures
  - ~~Branch~~
  - ~~Stick~~
  - ~~Bush~~
  - ~~Flat rock (and others)~~
  - ~~Cricket~~
    - Hop
  - Squirrel
    - Steal
  - Fish
    - Swim
  - Birds
    - Flap
- Lights can be moved/dappled
- Sounds can be layered up
- UI includes success and boredom indications
- Start menu included (button to be scratched to unleash the walnut to start with? volume settings?)

Todo essentials:
- Make target manager.
- Control activation and deactivation of each walnut locator.
- Make UI - right click and left click images based on level in hierarchy (Waypoint vs Location vs Prop w/o Interactible)
- Count up Bored for each non-useful interactible; end game when Bored exceeds limit.
- Get texture on Terrain!
- Good ending UI clarity
